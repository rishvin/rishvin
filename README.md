*Hello :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:*

*Welcome to my Github page.*\
*I am a software engineer by profession. I am fond of learning new technology particulary in the areas related to distributed computing, databases and AI; and apply them to create something new. I'm an animal and nature lover and I care for them :dog2: :palm_tree:.*

*I occasionally write tech blogs here https://rishabjoshi.com*
